# Address Updater Project

This project focuses on building a user interface application to manage addresses. It includes functionalities such as adding, editing, deleting, and updating address information.

## Functionality

### Add
- Users can add new addresses with complete information (e.g., street address, city, state, zip code).
- The system validates user input for completeness and format.
- There is a mechanism to handle potential duplicate entries.

### Edit
- Users can edit existing addresses and save the changes.
- All address fields are editable.
- The system prevents invalid data during editing.

### Delete
- Users can delete unwanted addresses.
- There is a confirmation step before permanent deletion.
- The system handles potential data dependencies (e.g., associated records) before deletion.

### Update
- Users can update existing addresses in real-time.
- The changes are reflected immediately in the interface.
- The system handles potential conflicts during updates (e.g., concurrent edits by multiple users).

## User Interface (UI)

- The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Functionalities are clearly labeled and easily accessible.
- Data is presented in a clear and organized manner.
